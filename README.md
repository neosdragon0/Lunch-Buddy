Lunch Buddy is a social networking app to allow for strangers to post requests to meetup for lunch/dinner at restaurants. 
This app is more focused on casual interactions rather than romance such as dating apps like Tinder or Bumble. 
For example, users cannot post a request to meet more than a month in advance.
